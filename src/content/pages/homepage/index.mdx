Hi, I'm Anup Jambhekar, a Principal Engineer at Virtual Pictures Inc. With over 15 years of experience, I specialize in full-stack development and currently expanding my skills in AI and LLMs.

I've led cross-functional teams and delivered enterprise solutions for high-profile clients including FBI, NASA, and major US agencies. My work spans web platforms, mobile applications, and industrial systems.

I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions and have patented a system for simulation and deployment of customized UI for power system controller devices. Always excited to connect and collaborate on challenging projects! ðŸš€
