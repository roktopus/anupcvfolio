## 🧙‍♂️ About Me

I am **Anup Jambhekar** 👨‍💻, Principal Engineer at Virtual Pictures Inc. 🎬, wielder of full-stack sorcery for **15+ years** ⏰.

I've led guilds of cross-functional adventurers 🏰 through the dungeons of deadlines ⏰, the dragons of scope creep 🐉, and the dark pits of merge conflicts 💀. Many were scarred 😵, but all delivered ✅.

## ⚡ Wizarding Tricks

- **Summoning regex demons** 👹 (and occasionally banishing them 🧹)
- **Brewing APIs** 🍺 strong enough to knock out junior devs 😵‍💫
- **Debugging bugs** 🐛 so ancient they answer only to dark rituals of `console.log` 📜

## 🧙‍♂️ Current Quest

Now I journey into the arcane realm of **AI and LLMs** 🤖, teaching machines to think 🧠, reason 🤔, and—on lucky days—not to hallucinate unicorns 🦄.

## 🎯 Call to Adventure

Call upon me when your quest requires code too complex for mere mortals 👥:

> **"Regexus Maximus"** ⚡ — reveal the pattern hidden in chaos! 🔍

> **"APIus Connectus"** 🌐 — may the endpoints answer true! ✅
